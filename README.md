# a/b Testing Analysis-
**Business Problem**
As a marketing agency, our primary objective is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for
our clientsâ€™ advertising campaigns. We have conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and
the other on AdWords, and we need to determine which platform yields better results in terms of
clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By identifying the most effective platform, we
can allocate our resources more efficiently and optimize our advertising strategies to deliver better
outcomes for our clients.

**Research Questions:**
- Which ad platform is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-effectiveness?
- How frequently do we observe days with high numbers of conversions compared to days with low numbers of conversions?
- Do more clicks on the ad really lead to more sales?
- What will happen when I do go with the Facebook Ad? How many facebook ad conversions can I expect given a certain number of facebook ad clicks?
- At what times of the month or days of the week do we observe the conversions?
- How does the Cost Per Conversion (CPC) trend over time?
- Is there a long-term equilibrium relationship between advertising spend and conversion rates that suggests a stable, proportional impact of budget changes on conversions over time?
